# Numerical Analysis
This repository contains my notes from my self-study of numerical analysis and scientific computing. The primary reference text for this self-study is the second edition of "Numerical Methods for Scientific Computing" by Kyle Novak. 
Which is comprised of three main parts. The first is regarding Numerical linear algebra, the second is more typical of what would be seen in a numerical analysis course, and the third is on numerical differential equations. 
I intend to cover the 1st and 2nd parts in their entirety and cover the third as I have time but with less depth. I plan to spend most of my time on the contents of part 2. I try to cover as many exercises as I have time for from each section and 
review previous sections' exercises frequently to gain understanding. I try to cover a variety of exercises regarding proof, computation, and implementation of algorithms and focus on the problems that focus on core ideas. A write-up of my solutions 
along with the questions I attempted can be found in [Exercises.pdf](https://github.com/Ca1eb3/NumericalAnalysis/blob/main/NumericalMethodsPart1/Exercises/Exercises.pdf). For each section I wrote a note sheet focusing on key definitions and important theorems.
These notes can be found in [Theorems&Defs.pdf](https://github.com/Ca1eb3/NumericalAnalysis/blob/main/NumericalMethodsPart1/Theorems%26Defs.pdf).
